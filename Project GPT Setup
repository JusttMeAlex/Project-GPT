This is a simple Discord chat bot built using discord.js and the gpt-3.5-turbo model from Open AI. This is the same model used for the popular chatbot Chat GPT.

How to setup

1. Install all the dependencies

- Using npm

```npm install discord.js openai dotenv nodemon```

2. Create a new file called ```.env``` and copy the format from ```.env.example``` (or you can just rename ```.env.example```)
3. Update ```.env``` with your own credentials.
4. Start your bot
- Using Nodemon
  ```nodemon index.js```

- Using Node
  ```node index.js```
5. Enjoy!


NOTE: The bot will crash if the response passes over 2000 characters so be careful with the bot:)
