This is a simple Discord chat bot built using discord.js and the gpt-3.5-turbo model from Open AI. This is the same model used for the popular chatbot Chat GPT.

How to setup

Install all the dependencies

1. Using npm

```npm install discord.js nodemon openai dotenv```

2. Create a new file called .env and copy the format from .env.example (or you can just rename .env.example)

3. Update .env with your own credentials.

4. Run the bot using

```nodemon index.js``` or ```node index.js```

5. Enjoy!
